# ros-vision-arm
This ROS 2 project implements a 2-DOF robotic arm system with camera-based ArUco marker tracking, real-time path planning, and motor control. It includes modules for visual localisation, inverse kinematics, and low-level hardware interfacing to enable autonomous object reaching and manipulation.
